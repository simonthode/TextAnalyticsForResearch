# TextAnalyticsForResearch
The following functions aim to assist analysts with qualitative research. They provide an easy means 
of examining a corpus of documents for key themes and ideas arising. These functions make understanding 
the subject matter contained within in a large amount of text easier, with the benefit of reducing bias.

Functions added so far are:
-word frequency counts
-bigram frequency counts
-network graph diagrams of a corpus of documents

The project also include python scripts for converting PDF documents into a tidy text format for easy analysis.
